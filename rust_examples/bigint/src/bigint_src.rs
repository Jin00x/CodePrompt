//! Big integer with infinite precision.

use std::fmt;

/// An signed integer with infinite precision implemented with an "carrier" vector of `u32`s.
///
/// The vector is interpreted as a base 2^(32 * (len(carrier) - 1)) integer, where negative
/// integers are represented in their [2's complement form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).
///
/// For example, the vector `vec![44,345,3]` represents the integer
/// `44 * (2^32)^2 + 345 * (2^32) + 3`,
/// and the vector `vec![u32::MAX - 5, u32::MAX - 7]` represents the integer
/// `- (5 * 2^32 + 8)`
///
/// You will implement the `Add` and `Sub` trait for this type.
///
/// Unlike standard fix-sized intergers in Rust where overflow will panic, the carrier is extended
/// to save the overflowed bit. On the contrary, if the precision is too much (e.g, vec![0,0] is
/// used to represent 0, where `vec![0]` is sufficent), the carrier is truncated.
///
/// See [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement#Arithmetic_operations) for a rouge guide on implementation,
/// while keeping in mind that the carrier should be extended to deal with overflow.
///
/// The `sign_extension()`, `two_complement()`, and `truncate()` are non-mandatory helper methods.
///
/// For testing and debugging purposes, the `Display` trait is implemented for you, which shows the
/// integer in hexadecimal form.
